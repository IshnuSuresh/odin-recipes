    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lemon icebox pie is a cool, creamy dessert with a bright citrus flavor and a smooth, melt-in-your-mouth texture. 
        Traditionally made with a graham cracker crust, the filling combines sweetened condensed milk, fresh lemon juice, and egg yolks or whipped cream to create a rich, tangy custard that sets in the refrigerator—no baking required. 
        It's topped with whipped cream or meringue and chilled until firm, making it a perfect make-ahead dessert for warm days or any time you want something light, refreshing, and satisfying.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>

        <li>2 cans (14 oz each) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (about 3–4 lemons)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>

        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream (for topping)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons powdered sugar (for whipped cream)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, and melted butter until well combined.</li>
        <li>Press the mixture firmly into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie dish to form a crust.</li>
        <li>Bake the crust for 8–10 minutes, then let it cool completely.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together sweetened condensed milk, lemon juice, lemon zest, and egg yolks until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Pour the filling into the cooled crust and spread it evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake the pie for 15–18 minutes, just until the center is set.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let the pie cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until fully chilled.</li>
        <li>In a chilled bowl, whip the heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla extract (if using) until soft peaks form.</li>
        <li>Spread or pipe the whipped cream over the chilled pie before serving.</li>

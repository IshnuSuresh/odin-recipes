    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sweet and sour chicken is a popular Chinese-inspired dish featuring crispy, battered chicken pieces tossed in a vibrant, tangy-sweet sauce. 
        The sauce is typically made with ingredients like vinegar, ketchup, soy sauce, and sugar, giving it its signature glossy red color and bold flavor. 
        Often paired with chunks of pineapple, bell peppers, and onions, sweet and sour chicken balances savory crunch with sweet, zesty notes. 
        Itâ€™s commonly served over steamed rice or noodles, making it a flavorful and satisfying main dish.</p>
